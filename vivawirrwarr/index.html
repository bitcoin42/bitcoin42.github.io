						<p>The primary goal is to restore value to what is left, and make it right.<br>
							At this point all of VIVA went back to it's original price. Seeing it this way, VIVA is truly price stable;
							Maintaining a most stable price at niltch, zilp, nada, zero. ;)<br><br>
							VIVA's design proposed that each ornamental headdress holder would have their own stream (chain),
							but without water (blocks), no streams, no blockchains.
							However, not all was vapor and now everyone has their knifes and forks on the table.<br>

						(Above image is the rebranded VIVA logo.<br>
						The empty space between the colorful cake pieces is the asterisk symbol (*), that stands for anything.
						The ASCII code for it is 42, which refers to its deeper root of Bitcoin42,
						the company that Alec Hahn started way before VIVA (back in 2014).<br>
						The companies tagline was; "we come in peace". Now this fits better; "We come in pieces". ;)<br>
						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 1 - VIVA</strong><br>
							What happens with it is up to Dawn.<br>
							Alec is leaving VIVA in good faith and wishes to exit the relationship by cutting up the cake as discribed below.<br>
							<li><a href="#">Read the letter to Dawn here, expressing his wish.</a></li>
							</h4>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 2 - TradeQwik</strong><br>
							For Joe and Rick to consider saving (and building a new) exchange, under the TradeQwik brand and bring in their community following conditions must be met:<br>
							<li>Viva Holdings LLC releases any claim to Tradeqwik LLC, but the liabilities remain with Viva Holdings LLC up to date and until all of the servers, domains and intellectual property are transferred to Tradeqwik LLC.</li>
							<li>All customers/participants/users sign an agreement to not hold the new owners of Tradeqwik LLC liable for anything that was done while Viva owned TQ (up until it is handed over).</li>
							<li>Joe and Ric continue under their game plan and organization they are and were pursuing already.</li><br>
							</h4>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 3 - Galaxy Vault</strong><br> Alec Hahn is going to make Galaxy Vault grow as it was envisioned, but also sperated from VIVA.
							When there is a VIVA Blockchain to work with, it'll be happely intergrated.<br>
							In order to make Galaxy Vault successful following conditions must be fullfilled:<br>
							<li>Viva Holdings LLC releases any past, current or future claim on Galaxy Vault and its subsidiaries and transfers everything related to it.</li>
							<li>Galaxy Vault will become a co-operative “bank” owned by over 50% by its members.</li>
							<li>Each VIVA Holder will recieve a tangibale token before it's pre-ico sale.</li>
							<li>If everything transitions well, all participants/users sign an agreement to not hold Viva Holdings liable to what they could make a legal claim to.</li><br>
							</h4>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 4 - Other Projects</strong><br>
							Last year was the year of hard forks in the Bitcoin world. Although VIVA has no technology to fork from, it has an community and sense of a common ideology.<br>
							<li>Some talented former members are spearheading an entirly differnt project, currently refered to as "Project X". <strong>They are planing a token airdrop on VIVA bagholders.</strong></li>
							<li>A other VIVA bagholder is offering his support by <strong>airdropping his algorithmically traded hyer-deflationary cryptocurrency "optitokens"</strong> on the community.</li>
							<li>There is also <a href="https://bitbay.market">BitBay</a> to mention. A cutting edge, reliable, long established feature rich proof of stake Blockchain, that gives you a passive income by a process called "staking". (This chain is also where the idea from a price stable rolling peg was borrowed from and is likly to actually accomplish it's goal.) Essentially everything VIVA promised could be built based on BitBay, but was always disregared by the former CTO. But for now it is not on the table, except that <strong>there is a BitBay airdrop in the planning.</strong></li>
							<li>Besides of going forward with Galaxy Vault, Alec is going some steps back to his roots as a general manager of NAOME also known as <a href="http://bitcoin42.com.mx">Bitcoin42</a>. It continues it's focus on blockchain education, ATMs and P2P trading, that basically is the equivilant of <a href="http://vivacoin.github.io/viva.cash/cover-bg-video.html">Viva.Cash</a>, but without the <a href="http://vivacoin.github.io/viva.cash/cover-bg-video.html">SMS payment system.</a></li>
							<li>Alec orginally started <a href="http://bitcoin42.com.mx">Bitcoin42</a> because he didn't know how to make a truly decentralized exchange. That has changed now not only because of this close up lesson of TradeQwik, but also because of the <a href="https://lightning.network/">lighting network</a>, which is making the highly anticipated atomic swaps an viable option. This is were a even older project arises, and also here some tokens will be dropped on bagholders if it has a chance to succeed. Introducting: <a href="http://nighttrader.github.io/">Nighttrader!</a>.</li><br>
							And finally there is the hope that more projects will come out of this community, and perhapbs some time in the future can be all tied together again.<br></h4></p>
						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 5 - Community</strong><br>
							Nothing of the above is worth it without an outstanding community. We all came together because we liked to dream big and see a positive change in the world.<br>
							Bla bla... something meaning full and inspriing here. <br>
							To make it up to everyone, the following summary explains an easy way how to recieve the new tokens that result out of this transformation:<br>
