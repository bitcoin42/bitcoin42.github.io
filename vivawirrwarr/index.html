						<p>The primary goal is to salvage any value from what is left, and make it right by distributing it amongst those affected by the VIVA theft and collapse.<br>
							VIVA's design proposed that each ornamental headdress holder would have their own stream (chain),
							but without water (blocks), no streams, no blockchains.<br>
							However, not all was tragedy in the end. Thanks to a great outpouring of support and patience it is possible to begin turning the tide.<br>

						(Short intermission: Above image is the rebranded VIVA logo.<br>
						Just one example of a talented designer who gave, like many others, his time and work in exchange for a number in a centralized, corruptible database.<br>
						Pictures say more than a million words. Alec wants to highlight the empty space between the colorful cake pieces. What we find is an (*), that stands for anything. The ASCII code for it is 42, which refers to its deeper root of Bitcoin42 (NAOME), the company that Alec started way before VIVA (back in 2014).<br>
						The companies tagline was; "we come in peace". Now this fits better; "We come in pieces". ;)<br>
						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 1 - VIVA</strong><br>
							What happens with it is up to Dawn.<br>
							Alec left VIVA in good faith. Dawn wanted to finish the audits before she makes any decions. Alec is done with waiting. Alec thinks she is only catching up on the job she neglected last year, that allowed Steven Dale Morrey to embezzle company funds. He also beliefes she is cooking the books <br>
							<li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/372174609/What-Needs-to-Happen-to-Salvage-Some-Value-of-the-Broken-Viva-Project">Read here the letter to Dawn, exiting the relationship.</a></li>
							</h4>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 2 - TradeQwik</strong><br>
							Earlier this year Joe and Rick considered saving (and building a new) exchange under the TradeQwik brand, but since there is no cooperation and communication going out from VIVA Holdings LLC that oppurtinuty is probaly lost.<br>
							What will happen with TradeQwik will be determined yet again by Dawn.
							</h4>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 3 - Galaxy Vault</strong><br> Alec Hahn is going to make Galaxy Vault grow as it was envisioned, but also sperated from VIVA.
							When there is a VIVA Blockchain to work with, it'll be happely intergrated.<br>
							In order to make Galaxy Vault successful following conditions must be fullfilled:<br>
							<li>Viva Holdings LLC releases any past, current or future claim on Galaxy Vault and its subsidiaries and transfers everything related to it.</li>
							<li>Galaxy Vault will become a co-operative “bank” owned by its members.</li>
							<li>Each VIVA Holder (Crown, TR, Viva, Vx, ect.) will recieve a tangible token (Most likly a ERC20).</li>
							<li>If everything transitions well, all participants/users sign an agreement to not hold Viva Holdings liable to what they could make a legal claim to.</li><br>
							</h4>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 4 - Other Projects</strong><br>
							 Last year was the year of hard forks in the Bitcoin world. Although VIVA has no technology to fork from, it has a community and a common sense of ideology.<br>
							<li>One VIVA bagholder is offering his support by airdropping his algorithmically traded hyer-deflationary cryptocurrency <a href="https://optitoken.io">"optitokens"</a></strong> on the community.</li>
							<li>Hardly anyone knows this but BitBay, a cutting edge, reliable, and long established proof of stake Blockchain, needs to be mentioned here as well. Essentially everything VIVA promised could be built based on BitBay. For now though it is not on the table due to our current situation with the state of VIVA coin. <strong>There is however, a BitBay airdrop in the planning currently.</strong></li>
							<li>Alec is going to his roots of NAOME, also known as Bitcoin42. Bitcoin42 will continues it's focus on blockchain education, ATMs and P2P trading that is quite similar actually to <a href="http://vivacoin.github.io/viva.cash/cover-bg-video.html">Viva.Cash</a>. The difference being it lacks an <a href="http://vivacoin.github.io/viva.cash/cover-bg-video.html">SMS payment system.</a></li>
							<li>Alec orginally started <a href="http://bitcoin42.com.mx">Bitcoin42</a> because he didn't know how to make a truly decentralized exchange. That has changed now.<strong>Some tokens will be dropped on bagholders</strong> if this project has a chance to succeed.<br>
							</h4></p>
						<p>
							<h4>
							<strong>Piece 5 - Community</strong><br>
							And finally there is the hope that more projects will come out of this inclusive community that cares about the human connection more than just numbers in a database and some sets of rules in code.<br>
              Nothing of the above is worth it without an outstanding community. We all came together because we like to dream and also see a positive change in the world.<br>
							To make it up to everyone, the following summary explains an easy way how to recieve the new tokens that result out of this transformational process:<br>
